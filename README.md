# 🎄 Advent of Code Haskell - Days 1, 2, and 4

Welcome to the **Advent of Code 2024** solution repository! This project showcases Haskell solutions to some of the exciting challenges from the Advent of Code.

## 📜 Challenge Overview

The Advent of Code is an annual programming event where participants solve daily puzzles in December. This repository includes our solutions for:

- **Day 1, Parts 1 and 2**
- **Day 2, Parts 1 and 2**
- **Day 4, Part 1**

You can read more about the challenges on the official Advent of Code site:

- [Day 1 Challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1)
- [Day 2 Challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/2)
- [Day 4 Challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/4)

## 💡 Our Solutions

We implemented these solutions using Haskell, embracing the language's elegant functional programming capabilities. Here's an overview:

- **Day 1:** Solutions involve reading inputs from text files and processing them using Haskell's standard libraries.
- **Day 2:** Advanced logic for validating and transforming sequences while adhering to constraints.
- **Day 4:** Tackling combinatorial problems with concise and efficient code.

Each solution is designed to be clear, maintainable, and efficient, demonstrating the expressive power of Haskell.

## 🚀 How to Run It

Want to try the solutions yourself? Here's how:

1. Ensure you have [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/) and [Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) installed.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advent-of-code-haskell.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd advent-of-code-haskell
   ```
4. Run the project for a specific challenge, such as Day 2 Part 2:
   ```sh
   cabal run
   ```

Output for each challenge will be displayed in the terminal.

## 🗂 Directory Structure

Here's an overview of the repository layout:

- **src/**: Contains the Haskell source files for each day's solution (e.g., `Day01Part1.hs`, `Day02Part2.hs`).
- **resources/inputs/**: Includes input files (`day01.txt`, `day02.txt`, etc.) used for solving the challenges.
- **test/**: Placeholder for potential test files.
- **Day4.cabal**: Cabal configuration file for building and running the project.
- **README.md**: This file.
