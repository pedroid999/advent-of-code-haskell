# 🎄 Advent of Code Haskell - Day 4

Welcome to the **Advent of Code 2024 - Day 4** solution repository! This project is all about solving fun and challenging problems in Haskell, and we're thrilled to share our approach for Day 4 with you.

## 📜 Challenge Overview

The Advent of Code is an annual event that delivers a new set of programming puzzles each day throughout December. This repository features our solution for **Day 4, Part 1** of Advent of Code 2024.

Check out the detailed description of the Day 4 challenge right here: [Day 4 Challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/4).

## 💡 Our Solution

We tackled the **Day 4 challenge** using Haskell, utilizing its elegant functional programming features to create a solution that's both efficient and easy to understand. We believe in keeping the code concise yet readable, embracing the beauty of Haskell's purity and expressiveness.
